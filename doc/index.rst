Imap-CLI's documentation
========================

Everyone is receiving more and more emails days after days and every mail client I know forced users to adapt their
working environment.

This is unacceptable, mails are simple. Mail management softwares must adapt to us !

`Imap-CLI`_ aims to provide a command line interface, a python API and a REST API to
consult and manage IMAP accounts:

* Get IMAP account status (New mails, mail counting… etc…)
* Get list of mails in INBOX (or any other directory)
* Search amongst mails by tag, header, or full text search
* Read mail
* Flag mail (Read, Unread, Delete… etc…)
